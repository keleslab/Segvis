Segvis is an R package that automatizes visualization tasks for high
throughput sequencing data. It allows the user to plot several marks
across specific genomic regions and functional profiles around specific
coordinates. Additionally, it is capable of performing these tasks
considering both strands by separate or the aggregate profiles of both
strands.
