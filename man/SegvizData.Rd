\title{SegvizData object and constructors}
\usage{
SegvizData(regions, files, is_pet = rep(FALSE, length(files)), frag_len = 1,
  mc.cores = getOption("mc.cores", 2L))
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{a \code{GRanges} object with the regions to be considered.}

\item{files}{a character vector with the location of the bam files that
contain the aligned reads.}

\item{is_pet}{a logical vector with the same length as files indicating if
the aligned reads in the respective bam file are paired.}

\item{frag_len}{a numeric vector representing the average fragment length
to which the aligned reads in their respective bam file are going to be
extended. For PE reads, this parameter is not considered.}

\item{mc.cores}{a numeric value with the number of cores to use,
i.e. at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously.}
}
\value{
\code{SegvizData} returns a \code{SegvizData} object which contains
the forward, backward and aggregated coverage for every aligned read file in
\code{files}.
}
\description{
\code{SegvizData} is a subclass of \code{GenomicRanges}, used to visualize
high-thoughput sequencing experiments across a set of user - defined
genomic regions.
