## Segvis: A package for visualization of high throughout sequencing data along genomic segments

This is an R package which attemps to automatize some tasks related to
the visualization of aligned read data.

Segvis provides different tools to summarize and visualize data:

- Extract read data of specified input regions

- Plot peaks of different conditions across the same set of regions

- Plot central measures for a set of regions with the same width
 
- Subset regions according to used defined annotations

- Plot the heatmap of signal curves accross regions separated by
  annotation

Some late changes:

- We added examples to all help pages, and we added a whole pacakge
  documentation

- The function `Segvis` (the segvis object constructor) was renamed as
  `buildSegvis`
